# Intro

Original project name is *ZEROKIT*.

Somewhere in sources you can find sig *ZPAG*. It's mean: Zerokit Powerful As Gog. What is in little-endian mean: GAPZ.

# Warning

The purpose of the project is not to stimulate malicious projects, but only laid out for the community concerned for academic purposes.

I am not responsible for the malicious use of this code, neither before nor now nor in the future.

It's my own research and development during 2010-2012 years. But some parts, like PowerLoader is not mine.
